## üëã Introduction

Apollo is a tiny blog built with Astro. The goal is to have a small tiny bundle size, near zero javascript, and an elegant design. The blogs are stored as markdown files in the repository itself.


## üì¶ Tech Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Static site generator.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Hosting platform.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type-safe JavaScript.

### Astro

This uses Astro [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) API to manage the blog articles. The articles are stored in as markdown in `src/content/blog`. There is frontmatter, but that is taken care of by Astro.

There are two types of SSG routes created:

| Route        | Description                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/[number]`  | Paginated list of articles (12 per page). `/` is the same as `/1`. |
| `/[slug]`    | Individual article page.                                           |

It uses [Astro's RSS integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/rss/) to generate an RSS feed for the blog.

[Experimental API for fonts](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/experimental-flags/fonts/) is used to load fonts from Google Fonts. It has `optimizedFallbacks` disabled, because it was switching fonts after load which was jarring.
